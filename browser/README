Sample Browser for OSB - osb-browser
----------------------------------------------------------------

 osb-browser is a simple browser for GTK widget toolkit. It is
 demonstration / test browser using  OSB Gtk API.

 The OSB Gtk API comes with NRCore -library, and it's located in
 gtkapi/ -subdirectory of NRCore source directory.

  -Sources for the osb-browser


Build Instructions
------------------

   1. Build and install OSB (libcurl, javascriptcore and nrcore)
   
   2. Install libglade2 and libglade2 development headers if not present at the system:
      Example (for linox. requres root access):
      # apt-get install libglade2 libglade2-devel

   2. Download latest version osb-browser from
      http://browser.research.nokia.com/

      Example:
      % wget http://browser.research.nokia.com/osb-browser-0.4.7b.tar.gz

   3. Unpack it 
      Example:
      %  tar xfz osb-browser-0.4.7b.tar.gz

   4. Configure it with 'configure', 

      Example:
      % ./configure

   5. Build it with make and install it
      Example:
      % make && make install

   6. Run it
      Example:
      % osb-browser http://www.nokia.fi


Code details
-----------

The code is in ANSI C, and it utilizes GObject type system to
enable object oriented programming.

Class Hierarchy
---------------

Glib classes:
     GtkWindow
	OsbBrowser

   
User Interface
--------------
 The ui is built with Glade-2, a visual user interface builder for
 GTK. Glade-2 saves the ui description to a xml file. libglade2
 -library is used to build the interface from the xml file 
 runtime.

  
NOTES
-----
  The browser itself is not intended to be used as a starting point for a
  real browser project, so its interfaces aren't documented. It is however intended
  to be introduction how to use the OSB GTK API. The OSB GTK API
  related code fragments are easily located from osb-browser.c and
  callbacks.c -files by searching for "khtml" strings. Those fragments
  show how to use the library in a manner that separates the browser
  from the html rendering engine.

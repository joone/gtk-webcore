	OSB: NRC Open Source Browser based on KHTML and WebCore

OSB software distribution is a browser component and a sample browser
made in OSB-project at NRC <insert group here> OSB stands for Open
Source Browser.

The information here is partially outdated


You need:
    - OSB source distribution (osb-jscore, osb-nrcore, osb-browser)
    - one of these:
      - Sofia wengine from http://iptel.research.nokia.com/sofia/ 
      - curl from http://curl.haxx.se, more recent than 7.11.0
    - libxml2 more recent than 2.6.0



BUILDING OSB
------------
	To build OSB follow the instructions below.
	In the text lines beginning with  % are commands to be
	executed. Lines beginning with # are comments

		

Build sofia-wengine
--------------------
	* Fetch and unpack sofia-wengine 

	You can use one available from
	http://isource.nokia.com/project/showfiles.php?group_id=29
	The sofiawe-1.9.7 is not available from the offical site
	at the moment, though.	

	You can also use our unoffical package from
	http://browser.research.nokia.com/

% wget http://browser.research.nokia.com/downloads/sofiawe-1.9.7.tar.gz
% tar xfz sofiawe-1.9.7.tar.gz
  
	* Configure and build sofia-wengine

% cd sofia-1.9.7
% ./configure
% make && make install
% cd ..
       If you want to install sofia to some other directory, provide
       ./configure with "--prefix=$YOUR_PREFIX   --exec-prefix=$YOUR_PREFIX"
       where YOUR_PREFIX is the prefix you want to use, for example
       $HOME. Additionally you need to "make install" differently:

% make && make install m4dir=$YOUR_PREFIX/share/aclocal


Build OSB
---------
        Most current release is 0.4.7b. Substitute $RELVER with it.


        * Get following files from http://browser.research.nokia.com/:
	
	 http://browser.research.nokia.com/osb-jscore-$RELVER.tar.gz
	 http://browser.research.nokia.com/osb-nrcore-$RELVER.tar.gz
	 http://browser.research.nokia.com/osb-browser-$RELVER.tar.gz

% export RELVER="0.4.X"
% wget http://browser.research.nokia.com/osb-jscore-$RELVER.tar.gz
% wget http://browser.research.nokia.com/osb-nrcore-$RELVER.tar.gz
% wget http://browser.research.nokia.com/osb-browser-$RELVER.tar.gz


       * Unpack the files. 

% mkdir osbf 
% cd osbf
% tar xfz ../osb-jscore-$RELVER.tar.gz
% tar xfz ../osb-nrcore-$RELVER.tar.gz
% tar xfz ../osb-browser-$RELVER.tar.gz


	* Build JavaScriptCore, the javascript interpreter

% cd osb-jscore-$RELVER
% ./configure 
% make && make install
% cd ..
	This builds JavaScriptCore and installs it to prefix
	/usr/local by default. If you want to install it to 
	different location, use "--prefix=/your/dir --exec-prefix=/your/dir "
	-flags after the ./configure command


	* Build Osb-Nrcore the actual html rendering engine

% cd osb-nrcore-$RELVER
% ./configure  
% make && make install
% cd ..     
	This builds Osb-Nrcore and installs it to /usr. It uses
	JavaScriptCore from directory /usr. If you installed
	JavaScriptCore with different prefix, and pkg-config can't
	find it you must provide pkg-config with the path of your own.
	This is most probable if the prefix is different than  /usr or /usr/local
	In this case, you need to use  command
	
% export  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/your/dir"
	
	 before the ./configure command.

	If you don't have sofia-wengine installed in a standard prefix,
	you also need to provide flag
	"--with-sofia=$YOUR_PREFIX" to ./configure, where
	LIBCURL_PREFIX is set to your defined prefix. 

	* Build sample browser which uses OSB (osb-browser)	

% cd osb-browser-$RELVER
% ./configure  
% make && make install
% cd ..
	This builds osb-browser and installs
	osb-browser executable into /usr/bin.
	To install the program in your own prefix, use flags
	"--prefix=/your/dir --exec-prefix=/your/dir"
	
	./configure tries to figure out where your OSB installation is, eg.
	what are the Osb-Nrcore & JavaScriptCore prefixes. If Osb-Nrcore
	was not installed with and standard prefix (/usr or /usr/local) 
	you need to provide pkg-config with the configuration path,
	with PKG_CONFIG_PATH -variable like above.	

Installed files
---------------
	After installation procedure you should have:
	Runnable binary installed in
	  /usr/bin/osb-browser

	Libraries installed in
	  /usr/lib/libjscore.*	  # javascript engine
	  /usr/lib/libkwiq_gtk.*	  # gtk implementation of QT widgets
	  /usr/lib/libkwiq_khtml.*  # rendering engine
	  /usr/lib/libkhtml_gtkapi.* # gtk api for osb

	Headers installed in 
	  /usr/include/osb/JavaScriptCore
          /usr/include/osb/Osb-Nrcore
			     
	Program Data in
	  /usr/share/osb/*.css	  #default stylesheets

	OSB configuration definition for pkg-config
	  /usr/lib/pkgconfig/osb-jscore.pc
	  /usr/lib/pkgconfig/osb-osb-nrcore.pc
	
	If you have installed packages with different prefixes, paths
	may vary.

Using OSB in your own program
-----------------------------
	
	Since 0.4.2, NRCore uses pkg-config program for configuration
	of other programs using it.

	pkg-config is standard build tool for gtk applications. Its
	purpose is to 
	  - find installed library (paths)
	  - determine the depends of the library
	  - determine version of the library
	  - determine compilation cflags needed for a program to be
	    compiled to use the library
	  - determine link flags needed for a program to be
	    linked to use the library
	  - provide additional information that might be needed, like
	    features compiled in the library

	
	To compile with OSB add following to your compile statement
           `pkg-config osb-jscore --cflags` `pkg-config osb-nrcore --cflags` 

	To link against OSB add following to your link statement
           `pkg-config osb-jscore --libs` `pkg-config osb-nrcore --libs` 

	Alternatively, if you use autoconf, you can use following
	snipet in your coÅ„figure.in
--	
	# Check for pkg-config
	AC_PATH_PROG(PKG_CONFIG, pkg-config, no)
	if test $PKG_CONFIG = no; then
	   AC_MSG_ERROR([Cannot find pkg-config, make sure it is installed and in your PATH])
	fi

	PKG_CHECK_MODULES(JSCORE, [osb-jscore >= 0.4.2])
	PKG_CHECK_MODULES(NRCORE, [osb-nrcore >= 0.4.2]) 
--
	These commands define variables
	  JSCORE_CFLAGS
	  JSCORE_LIBS
	  NRCORE_CFLAGS
	  NRCORE_LIBS 

	which can be used for example in following way later on in
	configure.in:

--
	CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS $JSCORE_CFLAGS $NRCORE_CFLAGS"
	LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS $JSCORE_LIBS $NRCORE_LIBS"
--

	NOTE.
        If you have installed OSB in different path than the default 
	( which is usually /usr/), you need to inform pkg-config where
	to find installed configuration files. This is done by setting
	PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable


	Example: installing OSB to $HOME directory

	JavaScripCore configuration in 'osb-jscore-0.4.7b/' directory:
	% ./configure --exec-prefix=$HOME --prefix=$HOME
	% make && make install

	NRCore configuration in 'osb-nrcore-0.4.7b/' directory
	% export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:$HOME/lib/pkgconfig/
	% ./configure --exec-prefix=$HOME --prefix=$HOME 
	% make && make install
	
	
	
Implemented features
--------------------

Engine supports:
       -Web standards (JavaScript,css,html4 etc)
       -Some widgets (though usually misplaced)
       -JavaScript, popups
       -HTTP GET works 

Known problems
      - Stoping of http requests is not handled at all, 
       -HTTP POST only partly implemented


      
If you come across a crash or other bug, please send them to us. With crashes,
it'd be better to send stack trace and/or a short description of what you were 
doing rather than .core file. There are many known segfaults.

If you have problems, we are more than glad to help you. Just send us email etc.
